  How has gender representation evolved over the years, and what insights can be derived to inform leadership decisions on diversity?


## **3. Data Source**
 
The dataset included employee demographics such as gender, age group, job level, department, and hiring date from 2012 to 2020.


## **4. Tools and Techniques**

  - **Tools:** Power BI for dashboard creation.
  - **Techniques:** Data cleaning, trend analysis, filtering by department/job level/region group.  
  *“Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard with slicers for filtering data by department, job level, age group, and region.”*


## **5. Approach**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified trends in gender representation over time.
3. **Visualization Design:** Created line charts for trends, pie charts for distribution by gender, and scatter plots for executive-level analysis.
4. **Interactivity:** Added slicers for dynamic filtering based on user preferences.


## **6. Key Insights**

1. **Gender Trends:**
   - The number of women in executive positions steadily increased from 2016 to 2020.
   - Men have consistently held a higher percentage of executive roles compared to women.
